\title{Create a DBI Database Connection Pool.}
\usage{
dbPool(drv, ..., validateQuery = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{drv}{An object that inherits from \code{\link[DBI]{DBIDriver-class}},
or an existing \code{\link[DBI]{DBIConnection-class}} object (in order to
clone an existing connection).}

\item{...}{Arguments needed for both \code{\link[DBI]{dbConnect}}
(mandatory if required by the \code{DBIDriver} you're using) and
\code{\link{poolCreate}} (optional) - all arguments should be named:
\enumerate{
  \item The required authorization arguments needed by the DBMS
  instance; these typically include \code{user}, \code{password},
  \code{dbname}, \code{host}, \code{port}, etc. For details check
  the appropriate \code{DBIDriver}'s documentayion.
  \item Optionally, override the \code{poolCreate} defaults:
  \code{minSize} (minimum number of connections that the pool should
  have at all times), \code{maxSize} (maximum number of connections
  that the pool may have at any time), \code{idleTimeout} (number
  of seconds to wait before closing a connection, if the number
  of connection is above \code{minSize}), and \code{validationInterval}
  (number of seconds to wait before validating the connection again).
}}

\item{validateQuery}{The query to run to verify that the connection
is valid (it should be as simple as possible). If this is not
provided, \code{dbPool} will try a few possibilities, but these are
not exhaustive.}
}
\description{
A wrapper around \code{poolCreate} to simplify the creation of a DBI
database connection pool. Check the documentation of \code{\link{poolCreate}}
for a generic overview of the parent function and the Pool object. The
main thing to point out is that, for \code{dbPool}, you always need to
provide a DBI driver (i.e. of class \code{\link[DBI]{DBIDriver-class}}),
and it should always be accompanied by the required authorization
arguments (see the example below).
